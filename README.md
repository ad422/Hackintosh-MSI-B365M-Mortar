**the provided EFI is only a sample for this build, it boots but I highly recommend to build your own EFI so you'll learn about things & how they work, head to the** [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)

## notes
- use `HfsPlus.efi` instead of `OpenHfsPlus.efi`
- create your own USB map with [USBToolBox](https://github.com/USBToolBox) in Windows
- `-v` (stands for Verbose) can be removed after installation
- OpenCanopy GUI isn't provided to keep it lightweight
- everything is set as per the [Configuration.pdf (0.7.9)](https://github.com/ad422/OSx86-MSI-B365M-Mortar/blob/main/Configuration.pdf) by Acidanthera for CFL-based sysstems
- `config-iGPU.plist` only works with the integrated Intel UHD 630
- [make your own](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Universal/smbus-methods/manual.html) SMBus SSDT (SBUS-MCHC) after install
- generate a `iMac19,1` SMBIOS using [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)
- OpenCore version is **0.7.9**
- no Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Kexts included such as [OpenIntelWireless](https://openintelwireless.github.io/)
- the provided EFI is able to boot **macOS 11** or **12**
- the propertry list must be named `config.plist`
- only use [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) to edit plist files, avoid configurators like OCAuxiliary, Clover & OC Configurator
- the SSDT's are prebuilts by Acidanthera, however I recommend to use [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime) to generate them or the manual way (as the prebuilts are kinda bloated)
